<p>I strive to make a client feel safe and comfortable by listening, honouring their story, and taking a strength-based, client-centered approach.</p>

<p>My theoretical orientation is mixed modalities, drawing upon person-centered, Solution Focused Brief Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), including ERP, and Family Systems.</p>
