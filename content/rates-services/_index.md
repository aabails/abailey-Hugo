- **Individual Counselling — $150 @ 50 minutes**
- **Sliding scale** fee for those who are facing financial hardship — please inquire.

### Session Format
The above sessions can be in‑person, online, or by phone. In‑person can take the form of a session in my office or going for a walk in nature, depending on the client's comfort level.

### Payment Methods
I accept cash, debit, credit, or Interac e‑Transfer and collect fees at the beginning of each session. A receipt will be issued by email after each session. Direct billing to Pacific Blue Cross available; the client will be responsible for any unpaid amounts.

### Insurance Coverage & Benefits
Services may be covered in full or in part by your health insurance or employee benefit plan. Please check your coverage carefully and know:
- Do I have mental health insurance benefits?
- Does my insurance cover a Registered Clinical Counsellor?
- What is my deductible and has it been met?
- How many sessions per year does my health insurance cover?
- What is the coverage amount per therapy session?
- Is approval required from my primary care physician?
- Does my provider support direct billing for counselling services?

### Cancellation Policy
If you do not show up for your scheduled therapy appointment, and you have not provided notification at least 24 hours in advance, you will be required to pay the full cost of the session.
