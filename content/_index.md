## Counsellor | Victoria, BC

Are you looking to make a change in your life or connect a young person with a youth counsellor in Victoria, BC?

I am dedicated to guiding young people through life's transitions and challenges with empathy and understanding. My mission is to create a supportive space where teens and young adults can explore their thoughts, feelings, and goals with a compassionate and skilled therapist. Whether you’re navigating the complexities of adolescence, dealing with stress or anxiety, or seeking to build resilience and self-confidence, I offer personalized therapy tailored to your unique needs.

Together, we can work towards a brighter, more balanced future. Reach out today to start a journey of growth and self-discovery.

My trauma-informed, solution-focused therapy approach utilizes the client's story and strengths to determine solutions that may not have been realized yet. I believe the client is an expert of their life and has the knowledge of what works best for them. I am a Registered Clinical Counsellor through the BCACC and trained in supporting the mental health of all individuals. I offer counselling in Brentwood Bay, a community of Greater Victoria, BC.
