## Individual Youth and Adult Services

During our initial meeting, I discuss the client's specific areas of concern with compassion and assess if we are the right client/therapist fit. From here, we will be able to create a personalized treatment plan and discuss how it can best work in the client's day-to-day life. I work collaboratively to identify goals of therapy and ensure the client is getting the most out of our time together.

I strive to make a client feel safe and comfortable by listening, honouring their story, and taking a strength-based, client-centered approach. My theoretical orientation is mixed modalities, drawing upon person-centered, Solution Focused Brief Therapy, Narrative Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), including ERP, and Family Systems.

### More on Youth Services

Life transitions, whether they are at school, home, or in the family (including pets) can be very challenging for young people to navigate during this major developmental time. As a teen counsellor I work with clients ages 10 and older and have a strong background in supporting youth in their pre-teen to late teenage years.

In my experience youth are extremely resilient and aware of their situation, sometimes having an adult they trust, but not directly involved in their day-to-day life can be beneficial to process and explore feelings, experiences, and relationships.

### Areas of Support for Youth include:

- Anxiety, depression, anger
- ADHD, OCD, learning disabilities, educational concerns
- Self-identity, sense of purpose, motivation
- Family connections, grief and loss, social situations
- Substance use
